## My process

I drew and cut out the model on a piece of paper, mentioning the semantic tag for each block. This made it easy to write down the structure of the web page.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 : BEM class names & custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I've learnt to use my eyes to assess measurements and distances between elements. I integrated this model **without using the Sketch files.**

### Continued development

For the next projects, I expect to implement the using of preprocessor as Sass.

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - This helped me for finding the right syntax of a CSS property and its value I looked for.
- [To validate my HTML5 code](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - I've used it to ensure that my code complies with W3C standards, and to correct where necessary.
- [To validate my CSS code](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) - This is the equivalent for the CSS3. Using these both validators is a good coding practice.
